# DevJournal

This program runs in the background, watching your files and keeping a log of
your edits while you work. You can also add comments and notes that are kept in
with timestamps, allowing you to look back through your edits in case you
accidentally delete or lose something.

DISCLAIMER: This project is not under active development; it is a utility I
wrote in grad school that I found while going through some old files and decided
to post on Github in case it's useful to someone. I no longer actively use it.

## Getting Started

To build the distribution file, run `ant dist`. Then run the `devjournal`
command in the repository root to execute the program.
